              automatically analyzing the activities of your team to provide search results, activity feeds,
              notifications, connections and recommendations that are most relevant for you and your team. For example,
              we may use your stated job title and activity to return search results we think are relevant to your job
              function. We also use information about you to connect you with other team members seeking your subject
              matter expertise. We may use your email domain to infer your affiliation with a particular organization or
              industry to personalize the content and experience you receive on our websites. Where you use multiple
              Services, we combine information about you and your activities to provide an integrated experience, such

              directly to us to troubleshoot and to identify trends, usage, activity patterns and areas for integration
              and improvement of the Services. For example, to improve the @mention feature, we automatically analyze
              recent interactions among users and how often they @mention one another to surface the most relevant
              connections for users. We automatically analyze and aggregate frequently used search terms to improve the
              accuracy and relevance of suggested topics that auto-populate when you use the search feature. In some
              cases, we apply these learnings across our Services to improve and develop similar features or to better
              integrate the services you use. We also test and analyze certain new features with some users before
