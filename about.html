          to shape a successful career.
        </p><br>
        <p class="msg section-1-box wow fadeInUp">Our system also overlooks the specific learning needs of each child,
          who is unique, resulting in immense stress. Shockingly, above 12,000 students commit suicides in India due to
          exam related stress. This number is alarming and makes us wonder where our system is going wrong!!!!!!!</p>

          experts from World renowned universities and is based on knowledge from Genetics, Embryology, Dermatoglyphics,
          Psychology and Neuroscience.</p><br>
        <p class="msg section-1-box wow fadeInUp"><b> Midbrain Activation</b> is the technique of optimizing the
          function of our middle brain, which is the ‘bridge’ between the left and right brain. Having this ‘bridge’
          activated allows for the retrieval of information between the left and right brain, which leads to more
          efficiency in learning and absorbing information. Scientists have discovered an important mid zone in human’s
          brain which is called the Mid-Brain. However, as the left-brain develops, it becomes harder to bring forth the
          abilities of the right brain. If the child’s brain is stuffed with knowledge, it becomes very difficult to
          exercise and develop the right brain. The Shichida Method believes in not over- emphasizing on knowledge
          education, and that the cultivation of the child’s ability to learn on his own is of utmost importance. Our
          core objective is to awaken a child’s brain by activating their mid-brain to unleash their potential where
          they can have an optimum way of learning by both brain’s hemisphere.</p>
